App description:

The Document Processing and Delivery Service is a comprehensive platform designed to automate the generation, management, and delivery of organizational documents such as invoices, pay slips, and various other types of correspondence. This service caters to businesses and institutions that need to efficiently produce and distribute large volumes of personalized documents while ensuring accuracy, security, and compliance with privacy regulations.

At the heart of the system is its ability to take structured tabular data provided by customer organizations—such as billing information, employee details, or transaction records—and merge this data with predefined document templates to create polished, ready-to-deliver documents. These documents are typically generated in PDF format, though the system is flexible enough to support other formats as required.

Once documents are generated, the system manages their delivery through multiple channels:

    Email Delivery: Documents can be sent directly to recipients as email attachments. The system integrates with various email providers to facilitate this.
    Download Links: Alternatively, the system can generate secure download links that are emailed to recipients. This option reduces the size of emails and can be useful for large files.
    Physical Mail: For organizations that require paper copies, the system can interface with print services to produce and dispatch physical documents via postal mail.
    Banking Integration: In cases where financial documents like invoices need to be sent through secure banking channels, the system integrates with banking services to ensure secure delivery.

User Interaction and Document Management

End users who receive documents can interact with the system via a secure web portal, where they can access their personal document store. This store is a personalized space where users can view, download, or delete their documents. Users can also manage their delivery preferences, choosing how they wish to receive future documents.

The system also includes a scheduling component that tracks document generation and delivery timelines, ensuring that all documents are dispatched according to the organization's requirements. This scheduler can automate recurring tasks, such as sending monthly invoices, making the system ideal for businesses with regular document distribution needs.


User control:

Users of the Document Processing and Delivery Service, specifically the end-users receiving the documents, have the following controls over their data:

    Access to Documents: Users can access their documents through a secure personal document store. They can download, view, or delete their documents as needed.
    Document Delivery Preferences: Users can set preferences for how they would like to receive their documents (e.g., via email or download link).
    Data Deletion: Users can request the deletion of their documents and associated data once it is no longer needed for delivery purposes. The system will automatically delete documents after a retention period of 1 year unless otherwise requested by the user.


Data policy:

The Document Processing and Delivery Service collects the following types of data:

    Tabular Data: Provided by customer organizations, this data includes information required to generate documents (e.g., names, addresses, amounts due).
    Templates: Predefined document templates provided by customer organizations.
    Generated Documents: PDFs or other document formats generated based on the input data and templates.
    Delivery Metadata: Information related to the delivery of documents, such as delivery status, document IDs, and recipient details.

Data is collected solely to perform the core functionality of the service, which is to generate and deliver documents. Data is stored only as long as necessary to fulfill this purpose and comply with legal obligations.

Data Sharing

The service shares data with the following third parties:

    Email Providers: For the delivery of documents via email.
    Print Services: For the physical delivery of documents.
    Banking Services: For the digital delivery of invoices and financial documents.
