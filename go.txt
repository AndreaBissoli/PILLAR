Introducing LINDDUN GO

Your Privacy Threat Modeling Companion

LINDDUN GO revolutionizes privacy threat modeling with a
lean card game approach.

Derived from LINDDUN, GO simpliﬁes the identiﬁcation of
privacy threats using 7 key LINDDUN threat types: Linking,
Identifying, Non-Repudiation, Detecting, Data Disclosure,
Unawareness and Unintervenability, and Non-Compliance.
With 33 threat cards highlighting the most common privacy
threats and system hotspots, this game transforms the
privacy assessment process into an engaging, collaborative
experience.

Designed for structured brainstorming with diverse teams,
LINDDUN GO requires only the card deck and a system sketch
to kickstart your dynamic journey. Whether you’re a seasoned
pro or new to threat modeling, it offers an accessible and
engaging way to address privacy concerns.

Gather your team, shuﬄe the cards, and let the adventure in
privacy threat modeling begin.

INSTRUCTIONS

Gather a diverse group of privacy enthusiasts, and bring
a simple sketch or diagram of the software system
under analysis. Game dynamics:

1. The ﬁrst participant picks a random threat card and
puts it on the table so that everyone can see it.

2. Assess if the illustrated privacy threat forms a

relevant risk in the system. For each hotspot in your
system, consider the card’s elicitation questions.

3. If the threat is possible, you have identiﬁed a threat.

Make sure to document the threat.

4. Other participants can join in and report any

overlooked threats.

5. When no one can discover any new threats, the next

participant draws a card and starts over.

6. The exercise is ﬁnished when all threat cards have

been discussed.

LINKING

What?
Learning more about an individual or a group by associating data
items or user actions. Linking may lead to unwanted privacy
implications, even if it does not reveal one’s identity.

Tell me more!
Linking refers to the process of associating different data
items (incl. metadata) in a manner that results in undesirable
privacy implications. Combining related data items may reveal
(additional) information about a data subject or groups of data
subjects.

So what?
Linking becomes problematic when it can result in inference
(learning more about individuals), singling out individuals,
aggregating additional data to build proﬁles, etc. This may
subsequently give rise to other threats, such as identifying.

IDENTIFYING

What?
Identifying threats arise when the identity of individuals can be
revealed through leaks, deduction, or inference in cases where
this is not desired.

Tell me more!
A key distinction is made between threats in the context of
identiﬁed data (where there is an explicit link), and identiﬁable
data (where the link can be derived based on a pseudonym,
identity-revealing content, or a small set of potential subjects,
known as the anonymity set, that allow (re-)identiﬁcation).

So what?
It can be undesirable to know the identity. Working with
identiﬁed data records requires additional protective measures
and can lead to other threats such as unawareness and non-
compliance.

NON-REPUDIATION

What?
Non-repudiation threats pertain to situations where an individual
can no longer deny speciﬁc claims.

Tell me more!
The system retains evidence related to a particular action or fact,
inﬂuencing the ability to deny claims. Examples of this evidence
include log ﬁles, digital signatures, document metadata, and
watermarked data, all of which can be attributed to an individual.

So what?
Non-repudiation threats impact the plausible deniability of
individuals, rendering them unable to refute speciﬁc actions
or involvements, such as submitting a whistleblower report or
casting a vote for someone.

DETECTING

What?
Detecting threats pertain to situations where the involvement,
participation, or membership of an individual can be deduced
through observation.

Tell me more!
Detecting can be done by observing communication
ﬂows, including interactions with a system or service, and
communication between systems. Detecting can also be achieved
by observing application side effects or system responses, where
the existence of certain data may be inadvertently revealed by
the system.

So what?
Observing or ascertaining the existence can be suﬃcient to learn
sensitive information about individuals. Furthermore, detecting
also facilitates linking and identifying, allowing for the inference of
additional information about individuals.

DATA DISCLOSURE

What?
Data disclosure threats represent cases in which disclosures of
personal data to, within, and from the system are considered
problematic.

Tell me more!
Disclosures should consider the best interests of the involved
data subjects, with the minimization principle playing a crucial
role. The system should be designed to only collect, process,
store, and share the minimum amount of personal data
necessary for the required functionality.

So what?
In addition to legal implications (non-compliance), this also raises
the likelihood and impact of theft, data leaks, and unwanted or
accidental disclosure to unintended parties. The more data is
disclosed to and by the system, the more likely it can be abused
for detecting, linking, identifying, or non-repudiation threats by
any of the threat sources considered.

UNAWARENESS AND
UNINTERVENABILITY

What?
Unawareness and unintervenability threats occur when
individuals are insuﬃciently informed, involved, or empowered
with respect to the processing of their personal data.

Tell me more!
These threats may arise when there is (1) insuﬃcient transparency
(individuals are not aware of the collection or processing of their
personal data or the personal data of others), (2) insuﬃcient
feedback (individuals are insuﬃciently informed about the privacy
impact they may cause to others by using the system), and (3)
insuﬃcient intervenability (individuals cannot access or manage
their personal data).

So what?
Unawaress and unintervenability are problematic because
individuals are not informed about the potential implications of
sharing personal data and cannot access or manage, withdraw,
correct, or limit the processing.

NON-COMPLIANCE

What?
Non-compliance threats arise when the system deviates from
legislation, regulation, or standards and best practices, leading
to the incomplete management of risk.

Tell me more!
When addressing potential privacy issues, also consider regulatory
compliance, data lifecycle management, and cybersecurity risk.
Pay speciﬁc attention to cases in which these aspects lead to
privacy problems.

So what?
Violation of regulatory compliance obligations can lead to severe
ﬁnes for the organization.
